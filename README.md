- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SJames528
- ðŸ‘€ I studied Mathematics at university, but took a Masters' in Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. I'm eager to expand my knowledge and practical skils
-    in the field of data science, and hopefully go on to earn a doctorate in this field.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in examining the mathematical frameworks of AI, and applying this theory to analyse datasets from such sources asenvironmental science,
-    cosmology, and natural language.
