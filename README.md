- 👋 Hi, I’m @SJames528
- 👀 After studying for a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Data-Intensive Astrophysics, I'm now undertaking a PhD in Astrophysical Data Science.
- 🪐 I'm eager to expand my knowledge and practical skils in the field of machine learning, with my research interests being gas/dust behaviour in galaxies (particularly at high-redshifts), galaxy evolution, and cosmological models.
