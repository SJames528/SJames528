- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SJames528
- ðŸ‘€ After studying Maths at undergraduate level, I now have Master's degrees in both Mathematics of Cybersecurity and Data-Intensive Astrophysics. I'm eager to expand my knowledge and practical skils in the field of data science and machine learning, and hopefully go on to earn a doctorate in this field.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in examining the mathematical frameworks of AI, and applying this theory chiefly to analyse and simulate astrophysical phenomena. My particular research interests are gas/dust behaviour in galaxies, cosmological models, and gravitational wave analysis.
